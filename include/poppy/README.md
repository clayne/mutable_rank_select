Library implemented by Efficient Computing at Carnegie Mellon, available [here](https://github.com/efficient/rankselect).

The data structures are decribed in the paper *[Space-efficient, high-performance rank and select structures on uncompressed bit sequences](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-38527-8_15)* by Zhou, Andersen, and Kaminsky.

The implementation uses PTSelect described in the paper *[A Fast x86 Implementation of Select](http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00990)* by Pandey, Bender, and Johnson.
